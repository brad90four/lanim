# Welcome to _Î»anim_!

Lanim is a Python library for creating programmatic animations. It's inspired by the Haskell library
[`reanimate`](https://reanimate.github.io/) and the Python library [`manim`](https://www.manim.community/).

It's currently in a very early stage, but we'll be actively working on growing the functionality.
